## 📖 Description
The Gesture Hardware Controller provides a touchless way to interact with devices through your hands. It combines computer vision with hardware control, enabling intuitive command over stepper motors and LED lights using natural gestures. This project makes human-computer interaction more engaging and accessible.

## 🔍 Overview
This system illustrates how computer vision connects to physical hardware. Its architecture includes:

- **Hand Tracking**: Uses MediaPipe to recognize hand movement.
- **Gesture Recognition**: Processes input in real-time with Python.
- **Communication with Arduino**: Sends commands over serial connections.
- **Hardware Control**: Manages stepper motors and LED lighting.

This project aims to advance the way we interact with machines in various fields such as robotics, creative installations, and rapid prototyping.

## 🌟 Features
- Real-time hand tracking for single or dual hands.
- Control devices using gesture-based commands.
- Adjust position and speed of stepper motors.
- Toggle LED lights on and off with gestures.
- Control LED brightness by hand movement.
- Implement gesture smoothing for better recognition.
- Modular structure for easy upgrades.

## 📋 System Requirements
To run the Gesture Hardware Controller, you will need:

- A computer with Windows, macOS, or Linux.
- A working webcam or compatible camera.
- Arduino board for hardware connections (e.g., Arduino Uno).
- Basic USB cables for connecting the Arduino to your computer.
- Python 3.6 or newer installed on your system.
- Required Python packages (e.g., OpenCV, MediaPipe).
